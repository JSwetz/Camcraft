//! The contrast arithmetic (M6.1 D): WCAG 2.x ratios over sRGB, the
//! readable text-on-fill choice, the follow law that derives a theme
//! file's unspelled accent states from its new accent, and the
//! readability gate a file must pass to land. Pure colour maths - no
//! chrome, no egui types beyond `Color32`; `theme::visuals` and
//! `theme_files::parse` are the consumers, and both built-in columns
//! stay hand-tuned (the dark-verbatim law keeps the snapshots
//! meaningful). The law this module enforces: a theme that cannot be
//! read is a visible refusal, not a style preference.
//! Provenance: the contrast formula is WCAG 2.1's public definition
//! (W3C REC); the derive-don't-trust-hand-typed-states architecture is
//! the sibling project's pattern at the user's direction; the
//! thresholds, the follow law's linear-light form and every number are
//! ours.
