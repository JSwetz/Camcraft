//! What the Boundary settings DO, in plain words (the user's hand-test,
//! 2026-11-06: "unclear what open boundary affects .. unclear what
//! boundary actually does"): the summary at the top of the Boundary
//! group, computed from the draft - which area is machined, where the
//! tool may stand, how far the area reaches - and the notices for
//! settings that have no effect on this kind (said, never silently
//! ignored). Egui-free: the page draws it, the tests read it.
//!
//! The sentences follow the area law in `camcraft_app::operation`
//! (`boundary.rs`): the open boundary picks the side, the offset grows
//! or shrinks, the extension reaches past exterior edges, includes and
//! excludes add and cut, and containment is an offset relative to what
//! the kind does natively with its region.
//!
//! Provenance: our own wording of our own area law; no vendor material.
