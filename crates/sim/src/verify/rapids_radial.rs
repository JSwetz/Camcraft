//! Law (d) for `Mode::Radial` (#79): a cross-drill rapid's tool body against the raw stock solid, minus the kerf the program's own cuts swept before it - the shop practice of traversing only outside the stock (machine-tool handbooks), read as a solid instead of a height field; our own design, no vendor material consulted.
//!
//! The column law ([`super::rapids`]) reads a rapid as a vertical tool
//! over a height field, and a horizontal bore is a tunnel no height
//! field can see - so for radial programs it stood down (M5.2 F2) and
//! trusted the kernel's traverse law. That left the post gate blind:
//! a station change through uncut stock (#77) posted with no warning.
//! This reading needs no column:
//!
//! - The stock is the prism the verifier already holds - the stock
//!   footprint (`cx.stock`, or the region standing in for it, exactly
//!   as [`Rest::in_stock`] reads it) under the stock top, unbounded
//!   below (a chuck-held bar's foot is in the jaws: reading it as
//!   stock only adds convictions). A turned bar or a box about the
//!   spindle is a Z prism, so the footprint IS the solid measured
//!   about the spindle, wherever the work offset puts it.
//! - The tool is its flute body: discs of radius `r - gouge_tol`
//!   (the mill law's disc, [`Rest::hidden_along`]) square to the pose,
//!   at the tip and every [`BODY_STEP`] back along the pose up to the
//!   flute length, under the controller's modal pose rule
//!   ([`super::midpose::intervals`], 0.5 mm of travel at the far end
//!   between samples).
//! - The kerf is what the feeds BEFORE the rapid swept (cut order, as
//!   M13.7 reads the column): a cylinder of the tool radius about each
//!   cutting move, extended back along the pose by the flute length
//!   when the move plunges along its own axis (the body followed the
//!   tip in). A retract up a just-drilled hole - and the peck's chip
//!   break - stands wholly in that kerf, so it is acquitted by the
//!   stock reading, never by the path's description of itself.
//!
//! A sample of the body in stock and in no earlier kerf convicts the
//! rapid: [`Warning::RapidInStock`], the mill law's own blocking word.
//! Sampled, so bounded rather than exact: the discs stand
//! [`BODY_STEP`] (0.5 mm) apart along the body and the tip travels at
//! most 0.5 mm (midpose's step) between samples, so a sliver of stock
//! thinner than that between two samples can slip through. Round a
//! disc, the [`RIM`] = 16 rim samples are chords of the rim circle:
//! between two of them the circle bulges `r (1 - cos(pi / 16))`,
//! about `0.019 r`, past the chord - a graze deeper than the gouge
//! tolerance by less than that, between two rim samples, can pass.
//!
//! Fail closed, by name: a context the reading cannot stand on - a
//! non-finite stock top or Z tolerance, a tool with no finite positive
//! radius - convicts every rapid of the program, and a rapid whose
//! stated (or held) pose is no direction convicts itself: the law
//! cannot place the body, so it never vouches for it. A flute length
//! that is zero or non-finite reads as a body one tool diameter long,
//! never as the bare tip.
//!
//! Cost (#79 review): the kerf list is built once, in cut order, each
//! cylinder with its box; a rapid takes only the earlier kerfs whose
//! box meets its own swept box (padded by the body and the radius),
//! newest first - the hole a retract rides is the last one cut. A disc
//! whose box misses the stock prism's box is skipped whole before any
//! polygon test, and the shared interval ends are sampled once.
