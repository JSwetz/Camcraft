//! Corner fillets (M11.1 B/C): contour corners and between-pass links
//! round a line-to-line direction change with ONE tangent arc (one
//! G2/G3 move). Provenance: the classical circle tangent to two
//! intersecting lines (analytic geometry; the corner-rounding practice
//! of CNC programming handbooks), emitted as RS-274 / ISO 6983 G2/G3
//! circular interpolation; clean-room, no vendor material.
//!
//! # The construction
//!
//! A corner `V` joins an incoming leg (unit direction `u`) to an
//! outgoing one (`w`), deflecting by `theta`. A fillet of radius `rho`
//! touches the legs `t = rho * tan(theta/2)` before and after `V` (the
//! tangent points `T1 = V - u t`, `T2 = V + w t`) and its center stands
//! `rho` off both legs on the inside of the turn. The arc lies inside
//! the triangle `V T1 T2`: it pulls the cutter center off the corner by
//! `e = rho * (sec(theta/2) - 1)` on the bisector, and never past the
//! legs. Every number is computed without a transcendental call
//! (`tan(theta/2) = sin/(1 + cos)`, `sec(theta/2) = sqrt(2/(1 + cos))`)
//! so the bytes are the same on every platform's libm (M4.2b's lesson).
//!
//! # The legality law (Prime Directive: never gouge, never silent)
//!
//! - **material side**: where the caller knows which side of travel the
//!   part is on (contours: `air_left`), a turn TOWARD the part is
//!   refused - its fillet would sit inside the turn, on the part's side
//!   of a path that already grazes it: a gouge by construction. A turn
//!   toward the air rounds; its arc stands farther from the part than
//!   the corner did, so the blend leaves corner REST, never a gouge,
//!   and that rest (`e`, the worst one) is stated in the notes for the
//!   stock sim to measure.
//! - **live geometry**: the whole triangle `V T1 T2` must sit on the
//!   legal side of the caller's cutter-center region (inside it for a
//!   pocket or bore, outside it for an outside wall): the chord `T1 T2`
//!   crosses no loop, touches no loop vertex, its midpoint is on the
//!   legal side, and no loop vertex stands strictly inside the triangle
//!   (an island poking into the corner). A refused radius is halved
//!   ([`SHRINK_TRIES`] times) before the corner is called blocked.
//! - **tool radius**: `rho <= r` - the rounding never claims more than
//!   the scale of the tool doing it.
//! - **leg room**: `t <= len/2` of each leg, so a leg shared by two
//!   corners feeds both and fillets never overlap.
//! - **tolerance / resolution**: `rho >= max(tolerance, MIN_BLEND_RADIUS)`;
//!   an arc under the op's own chord tolerance says nothing the corner
//!   did not, and below the resolution no control interpolates it.
//! - **shape**: only line-to-line corners round (a curved neighbour has
//!   no straight leg to trim), a full reversal has no tangent fillet,
//!   and a closed walk's seam - where it starts and ends - stays where
//!   the entry put it. Each refusal keeps its sharp corner and is counted by
//!   reason; nothing is silent.
