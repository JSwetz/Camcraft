//! A contour level's first engagement (moved out of `contour.rs` by
//! M11.2 C): the level link's lift - clearance or the retract plane -
//! and the descent by the entry (first engagement) or the user's
//! transition (every later level): the bore side's certified arms, the
//! tabbed bore's axial dive, the wall side's graze.
//!
//! Provenance: standard multi-depth profile entries of published CAM
//! practice (lead-in from air, plunge/ramp/helix where bounded air
//! certifies them); the certification laws are `levels.rs`'s (M8.1/M8.2).
