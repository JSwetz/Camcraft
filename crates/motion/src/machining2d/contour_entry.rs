//! Contour level engagement: the bore-side entry arms (moved here from
//! `contour.rs` unchanged), the wall-side arc entry, and the closed-ring
//! seam law that keeps a lead-in and its lead-out from crossing.
//!
//! Provenance: the vertical-plane arc lead-in of general machining
//! practice (RS-274 / ISO 6983 circular interpolation in a vertical
//! plane, posted as one G18/G19 arc or, oblique, as chords - see
//! `entry_arc`) and the standard
//! multi-depth profile transition of published CAM practice: lead out,
//! retract to the retract plane, traverse, feed back in - or stay down
//! and link at feed where the link runs in air. Legality is
//! `lead_fit`'s sampled room law. No vendor material consulted.
