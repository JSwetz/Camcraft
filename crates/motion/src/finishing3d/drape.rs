//! Project generalization (M2.5 D3): drape ANY closed curve the model
//! itself carries, not just the XY silhouette.
//!
//! Provenance: projecting a part's boundary/trim curves along Z onto
//! the machining surface is public CAM practice ("projected
//! finishing", described in machine-tool handbooks at the level of
//! behavior). The construction here - weld-scaled open-edge chaining
//! and the column-grounded march of the resulting loops - is our own,
//! reusing this crate's crease-pair weld/chain and the shadow
//! families' march laws verbatim: two truths, one code. Nothing was
//! read from any vendor's code or output.
//!
//! ## The law
//!
//! M2.2e's Project marched one curve: the center-shadow's boundary -
//! the silhouette, the shallow facets translated by `r·m_xy`. A part
//! whose surface is an open shell (a trim, a sheet, a face with a
//! hole in it) carries its own closed boundary curves in 3D: the
//! edges where facets end. Those are the model's TRUE rim, and the
//! silhouette is only its shadow, displaced from the rim by the
//! tilt term. D3 drapes both: the silhouette first (unchanged law,
//! unchanged bytes), then every closed boundary loop of the mesh -
//! its XY kept, its Z grounded by the column law (`plunge_support`),
//! marched by the same `march_loop` the rim rides. A hole's rim in a
//! tilted plate is cut exactly where the plate's edge is, not where
//! its shadow falls.
//!
//! A CLOSED MANIFOLD has no open edge, so it gains no loop: for
//! every solid model in the goldens, project answers exactly as it
//! did before this file existed, byte for byte. Boundary segments
//! that chain into open runs (a crack, a T-junction) are not closed
//! curves: they are refused by count - reported in a note, never
//! silently cut as if closed.
