//! The wrap space's world exit (M5.1 stage E2): a planned toolpath
//! living in developed coordinates (s, v, ρ) comes back onto and
//! around the fitted axis of [`super::axis`], posed by the same lean
//! law the rotary finishing kinds use.
//!
//! Ball centers map back at the plan's own ρ plus one tool radius (a
//! radial ball's CENTER stands r outside its tangent cylinder), and
//! the emitted point is the TIP under that center along the pose it
//! holds - on the cylinder itself for a pure radial (the M13 pivot
//! law, [`super::retip`]: the stream locates the tip, and a center
//! posted as a tip stood every level one radius off its skin). Every
//! wrap arc is chorded (no wrap circle is a world circle), and - the
//! law this exit adds to the twins' - no s-sweep is a world LINE
//! either: a wrap straight laps the axis, so each resampled chord
//! spans at most ARC_FIT_TOL of sagitta on the position circle.
//! Rapids state the pure radial (the post's tilt is modal, and a hop
//! lapping the bar with the last cut's fixed direction would swing
//! the tool through it); cut moves stand RADIAL with the lean, both
//! computed in world coordinates straight off the axis line from the
//! very center being emitted
//! (so the stamped axis and the developed point share bits and the
//! two frames pose identically), with [`super::tilt`]'s lean applied
//! about it. A radial feed - a dive leg running straight at the axis
//! - has no tangent plane to lead in; on a surface of revolution the
//!   plane is not missing, the azimuth supplies it, and the lead
//!   rides the constant-`s` plane the wrap itself lives in.
//!
//! Issue #9 (review): under Adaptive the developed XY arcs chord at an
//! ANGULAR cap as well as the sagitta ([`ADAPTIVE_TURN_DEG`] a chord,
//! end chords 0.01 mm of arc): the planner's ~1.5 mm lead and smoothing
//! arcs chorded by sagitta alone turn ~13 degrees at each chord vertex,
//! past the 5 degree in-cut law the developed plan was proved under.
//!
//! Provenance: unwrapped-to-developed toolpath reconstruction from
//! public multi-axis turning-milling literature; composed on this
//! codebase's own axis fit and lean laws. Nothing of any vendor's
