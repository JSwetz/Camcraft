//! 2D regions: closed loops with even-odd semantics, booleans and buffering.

//! Provenance: the region model (closed boundaries, even-odd containment) is
//! the standard polygon-clipping formulation from the published literature;
//! the boolean/offset engine behind the bridge below is `clipper2-rust`, a

//! dependency, not adapted code, and zero vendor CAM provenance either way.
//! The millimeter bridge, validation gates and measurements are ours.

//! 1 um, far finer than any CAM tolerance). Inputs must be finite and far
//! inside the i64 horizon; anything else becomes a `GeoError`, never a
//! garbage number or a panic (Prime Directive).
