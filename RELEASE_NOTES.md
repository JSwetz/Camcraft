# CamCraft 0.7.0 (clean-room implementation)

Seventh public release: the user-review release. Most of what is new came
straight from hand-testing 0.6.0:
- the operation dialog now reads like a CAM dialog;
- simulation playback no longer locks up;
- lead in / lead out is complete;
- adaptive clearing is a real HSM spiral;
- every boundary says what it does.

Under it, a run of safety work: wherever the verifier had a blind spot, it was
closed. Where a plan could not be made safe, it is refused by name instead of
posted.

This is an independent, clean-room reimplementation of user-visible HSMWorks
behavior, specced from published documentation and general machining knowledge.
"HSMWorks" is a trademark of Autodesk; this project is unaffiliated (see
AGENTS.md). Third-party notices: `assets/ui/LICENSES.md`.

Please start with `TESTING.md`: a short hand-test list for what changed.

## What's new since 0.6.0

### From your review
- **The operation dialog, Fusion-style.**
  - Label and value share a row, units sit beside the value, and fields are
    grouped in collapsible sections.
  - Only the fields the current choice uses are shown.
  - "0 = auto" fields became explicit Auto toggles, and help moved to tooltips.
  - A one-line status banner sits at the top; a fixed action bar at the bottom
    has Generate as the primary action and Delete set apart.
  - The tabs stay.
- **The boundary says what it does.**
  - One plain sentence per setting, a "Machine the other side" button, and a
    notice when a setting has no effect on the kind.
  - The viewport fills the area actually swept; open edges are dashed.
  - Contour now rides an open boundary as one open pass.
- **Simulation that keeps up.** Playback runs on a worker thread: a UI frame
  went from 182 ms to 0.13 ms, and the stock follows the cutter. Each picture
  uploads only the changed bricks (2 MB to 57 KB).
- **Source is the stock or a part.** G54, setups, tools and fixtures are no
  longer offered, and are refused if a file names them.
- **Pick a vertex, set the origin there.** A new "Vertices" pick mode; "Set
  origin" on a picked vertex or face (centroid, or Z only on a horizontal
  face). It is undoable.
- **Panels always come back.** There is a permanent viewport, a Panels… menu
  and Reset layout. Operation-page errors clear, and Clear toolpath removes the
  path, not the operation.

### Machining
- **HSM adaptive.**
  - A constant-load spiral with no kinks past 5° and one entry per level.
  - The optimal load is set in % of D.
  - Narrow slots join their pieces with lifted returns (floor air 11 m to
    0.9 m).
  - A plan that can't be made sane falls back to offset rings by name.
- **Lead in / lead out, complete.** Ramp angle and length, a continuous helix,
  and arc radius and sweep, all in one tab.
  - Every entry has extensions, entry feeds and an engagement limit.
  - Heights can be measured from the selection.
  - A plunge height of 2 mm applies.
- **Plane-aware transitions.** Arcs carry their plane: G17/G18/G19 in the CL
  and every post. Arc entries post as true vertical arcs.
- **Keep-down links** and plunge, ramp, helix or arc level transitions on every
  ladder operation; how levels link is your choice.
- **New entries.**
  - A horizontal (G17) arc entry for pockets.
  - Face entries run out to air for tools that are not centre-cutting.
  - 3D ladders slow only the first diameter of cut.
- **Area control.** Inside, on or outside containment, boundary offset and
  extension, extra include/exclude boundaries, and open boundaries that start
  outside the stock.
- **Smoother paths.** Tangent arc blends at corners and links (line-arc and
  arc-arc too), and facing reversals become single arcs.
- **More finishing.** Flowline, steep-and-shallow, flat area, pencil and corner,
  ramp, morphed spiral, geodesic, blend, ruled loft, project drape, deburr, 3D
  offset shells.
- **2D additions.** Engrave, chamfer, circular, standalone bore, helical thread.
- **Rotary and 5-axis.**
  - Posed ball tools post the tip, so they land on plan (they were 4.2 mm off
    on 5-axis).
  - Rotary programs open on the clearance pose, and Rotary Parallel links run
    radially.
- **Machine limits and cutting data.** Spindle speed and power are checked, and
  speeds and feeds are suggested per material.

### Safety (the Prime Directive)
- The verifier judges the tool against the part's real solid, with the tool's
  real tip. A program it can't judge says so.
- Closed blind spots:
  - stock under overhangs;
  - a positive stock-to-leave that hid a gouge of that depth;
  - cuts that only happen later in the program;
  - tilted holders sweeping through a chuck;
  - the spindle on tilted rapids.
- Tools that are not centre-cutting never plunge into solid, anywhere: 2D, 3D,
  drilling, Face and every multiaxis kind. They ramp, helix, or are refused by
  name.
- No level under a blind floor; 2D pockets and contours see what hangs above
  them.

## Projects
- The project format goes from v42 to v49. Older projects load. New fields are
  written only when used, so a re-saved 0.6.0 project only grows where you
  change something.
- The persistence of picks, open boundaries, vertex picks, fixed fixtures and
  the pocket arc entry is round-trip tested.

## Known limits (tracked in ROADMAP.md)
- Adaptive island pockets fall back to offset rings, by name.
- Rotary Parallel's radial infeeds and Swarf's first raster entry always plunge.
  With a tool that is not centre-cutting they are refused rather than ramped.
- The fixed-fixture flag has no UI toggle yet, and the generate-time fixture
  check still uses the stricter older law; the post gate applies the new one.
- Building is Windows-first. Linux and macOS build from the same source (M4.2);
  code signing and an installer are still owed (M13.3).
